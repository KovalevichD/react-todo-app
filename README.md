# Very simple todo-app

## About

This is the simplest todo-app. You can add your tasks and group them. Good luck!
I used fake server "json-server" https://github.com/typicode/json-server 
The data is in the file db.json
## Install

```bash
npm install 
```
and install JSON Server
```bash
npm install -g json-server
```

## Start

start fake server first
```bash
json-server -p 4000 db.json
```
then
```bash
npm start
```
